# Huffman-Coding-Algorithms

Encodes and decodes text from input files using Huffman coding. Reads mutiple input files a byte at a time, counts the number occurrences of each byte, sorts the bytes by frequency, builds a Huffman tree, reads and encodes the file data, reads and decodes the encoded file data, then compares the decoded file with the original input file.

Programming language: C++
